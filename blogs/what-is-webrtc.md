# What is WebRTC?

# Summery

WebRTC is a big bundle of open source technology.
Are you planning on building Skype on web and mobile?
WebRTC makes it easy for you to create new types of communications apps which require Audio or Video streaming.
Even better WebRTC allows you to connect two users Peer-to-Peer.
This style of connectivity is phenomenal for businesses saving on the tranditional middle-man server bandwidth costs.
The full WebRTC package includes P2P, Data Streaming, Video and Audio Codecs 
for transmission of live conversations between one or more peers.
WebRTC also includes the mechanisms for P2P (Peer-to-Peer) connectivity via common STUN
to generate network topology route ICE candidates (Interactive Connectivity Establishment).

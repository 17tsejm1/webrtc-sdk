# What is WebRTC?

# Summery

WebRTC is a big bundle of open source technology.
Are you planning on building Skype on web and mobile iOS/Android?
WebRTC makes it easy for you to create new types of communications apps which require Audio or Video streaming.
Even better WebRTC allows you to connect two users Peer-to-Peer.
This style of connectivity is phenomenal for businesses saving on the tranditional middle-man server bandwidth costs.
The full WebRTC package includes P2P, Data Streaming, Video and Audio Codecs 
for transmission of live conversations between one or more peers.
WebRTC also includes the mechanisms for P2P (Peer-to-Peer) connectivity via common STUN
to generate network topology route ICE candidates (Interactive Connectivity Establishment).

# Is WebRTC Easy to Use when Developing Mobile and Web Apps?

We built an SDK for you.
At PubNub we believe simplicity is essential for our SDK usability.
We've taken a simplified approach to WebRTC Peer Connections by creating
and easy-to-use SDK for developers.
Simplicity should be included in all platforms and devices.
That's why we support **Android** WebRTC mobile calling
with compatibility for iOS native Objective-C based WebRTC SDK.
Our simple free developer WebRTC SDK is powered by
[PubNub Data Stream Network](http://www.pubnub.com/) for 
[High-replication Signalling via Data Streams](http://www.pubnub.com/how-it-works/data-streams/), 
[Call Presence Connectivity Detection](http://www.pubnub.com/how-it-works/presence/), 
[Phone API for Push Notifications](http://www.pubnub.com/how-it-works/mobile-push/), 
[Call Event Logging Storage and Playback](http://www.pubnub.com/how-it-works/storage-and-playback/) and

# What is WebRTC?

WebRTC is a big bundle of open source technology.  
The full WebRTC package includes Video and Audio Codecs for streaming live conversations.
WebRTC also includes the mechanisms for P2P (Peer-to-Peer) connectivity via common STUN
to generate network topology route ICE candidates (Interactive Connectivity Establishment).
